# River Productivity Modeling

## 2020-11-13 Update

1. Currently working from "./code/Productivity_Model_Simulations - Oregon Test.Rmd" to simulate data
* This RMD links to to the data simulation code and Stan models described below in (2)

2. There are three versions of the model to simulate data that correspond to Stan versions of those models in the code folder:
*"Simulated_ProductivityModel1_Autoregressive.R" & "Stan_ProductivityModel1_Autoregressive.stan"
*"Simulated_ProductivityModel2_Logistic.R" & "Stan_ProductivityModel2_Logistic.stan"
*"Simulated_ProductivityModel3_ThinFilm.R" & "Stan_ProductivityModel3_ThinFilm.stan"

3. Help needed from Bob:
